  <h2>With all the challenges at hand, what can we do to conserve our precious marine resources? How do we prevent them from going to waste?</h2>

  <p>When it comes to marine conservation, preserving vulnerable resources always comes first. Tropical coral reefs, which comprise over 0.1% of the total ocean area, are ranked among the top biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Such diverse ecosystems support almost one-quarter of all marine species. Every one of us has a responsibility to play a critical role in protecting coral reefs. Whether you live near the coast or hundreds of miles away, you can take steps to ensure coral reefs remain healthy and conserved.</p>

  <p>Here are some ways you can contribute from home to conserve marine ecosystems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Recycle and dispose of your trash responsibly - use the 3 R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!</li>
    <li>Use fertilizers sparingly to prevent runoff pollution</li>
    <li>Reduce your consumption of plastic to minimize ocean pollution</li>
  </ul>
