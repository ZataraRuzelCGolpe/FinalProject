  <p>Our marine ecosystems play indispensable roles in sustaining nature, humanity, and our planet. They offer 
     essential services such as regulating Earth's temperature by absorbing excess heat, storing and purifying 
     freshwater, providing natural infrastructure to protect from storms and erosion, and generating more than half 
     of the oxygen we breathe.</p>  

  <p>However, the health of these ecosystems faces a grave threat from the triple planetary crisis and other pressures 
     such as overfishing, pollution, and unsustainable development. With that, we must be educated on the importance
     of maintaining the health of marine ecosystems so that they can continue thriving and because we also benefit
     from them.</p>

  <p> It is evident from all the articles that organizations such as UNEP, NOAA, WWF, and etc. publish,
      that our oceans are not at their best conditions with increasing human activity that emits
      plenty of toxic wastes that harm these blue ecosystems. To find out more about these threats, click 
      on the "Go to Next Page" button and it will take you to another page that discusses further on the 
      specific harmful events that pose risks to the world underwater.</p>

    <p>Blue ecosystems like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass meadows provide coastal protection, support marine 
    biodiversity, and are essential in carbon storage and climate regulation.</p>

  <h2>
    A functioning planet Earth relies on healthy and productive blue ecosystems ‚Äì from coral reefs and seagrass meadows to 
    rivers and wetlands. It is our responsibility to take care of these ecosystems as our resources come from them as well.
