            <p>Think of our oceans and seas like giant gardens that give us so much. 
               They provide food like fish, and many people earn their living by working 
               with the sea. Before we had lots of machines and tools, people used the ocean 
               in simple, age-old ways to get what they needed.  It became one of the major
               ways in which people support their families from, especially those who live
               near bodies of water.
               <br><br>
               But as we developed new technologies and did more things, we started to harm 
               these big water areas. Imagine accidentally spilling paint in a beautiful pond 
               â€“ that's kind of what we've been doing to the oceans. Such a waste of the natural
               resource and it also destroys the peaceful ecological system that inhabits the pond.
               Spillage is actually one of the many different types of pollutions that bodies of 
               water experience, an example of this is oil spillage from factories and such.  Now, 
               it's super important that we learn how to be good caretakers of everything in the 
               ocean. It's like learning how to water plants and make sure they have sunlight so 
               they can keep growing. We need to learn how to use the ocean's resources without 
               spoiling them.
               <br><br>
               Lots of helpful groups are working hard to clean up the "spills" and protect 
               the plants and animals in the ocean. But the damage is happening faster than 
               they can fix it. This is why we all should be aware of the effects of man-made 
               pollution on the natural resources that we have as its condition is in risk after
               plenty of exposure to harmful substances that are released by artificial
               <br><br>
               This website is a guide that will teach you how we can use the ocean in a smart
               way, so it stays healthy and full of life for many years to come. It's about making 
               sure we don't take too much and that we help the ocean stay clean and strong. This is
               to ensure that the our water bodies remain intact and can benefit the future
               generations to come. So let's dive deeper into the underwater world, it's threats and
               how we, as people, can help in the conservation of the marine resources we possess.</p>
