     <h2>With all the challenges at hand, what can we do in order to conserve our precious marine resources? How do we prevent them from going to waste? </h2>

     <p>When it comes to marine conservation, preserving vulnerable resources always comes first. Most important, tropical coral reefs comprise over 0.1% of the total ocean area. These are ranked among the top bio-diverse ecosystems on Earth.  Such a diverse ecosystem supports almost one-quarter of all marine species' resources.Every one of us has the responsibility to play a critical role in protecting coral reefs. Whether you live near the coast or hundreds of miles away, you can do several things to ensure coral reefs are healthy and conserved.  </p>
     <p> Here are some ways that you can do at home that will contribute to conserving marine ecosystems: </p>
     <ul>
        <li> Recycle and dispose of your trash - use the 3 R's!</li>
        <li> Using fertilizers in a limited amount </li>
